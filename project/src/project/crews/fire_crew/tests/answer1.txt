# Agent: Fire Expert
## Task: Given the description of a fire incident and the information about the firefighter units (type and quantity) in a firefighter station, your goal is to analyze the situation and answer the following question: which units are necessary to use in order to properly assess the fire incident.  You must only use the necessary types of firefighter units and determine the necessary quantity. You cannot use a higher number of firefighters than the ones available per type. You cannot use types of firefighter that are not in the firefighter station.



# Agent: Fire Expert
## Final Answer: 
Based on the fire emergency context, I recommend the following firefighter units to assess the situation effectively:

* Team Leader: 1 (already present in the station)
* Hose Operator: 3 (to handle the high-pressure fire hose and provide water supply for extinguishing the electrical fire)
* Search and Rescue Specialist: 2 (to assist with rescue operations due to flames being too close, and to navigate through the burning building)

Total units required: 6

The Team Leader will lead the operation, while the Hose Operators will focus on delivering water to extinguish the fire. The Search and Rescue Specialists will help locate individuals in need of assistance and navigate the hazardous environment.

This combination of roles and personnel will allow for a safe and effective assessment of the situation, taking into account the severity and type of the fire, as well as the resources available at the firefighter station.


# Agent: Firefighter Planner Agent
## Task: You have a description about the personnel, equipment, and vehicles of a firefighter crew to address a fire incident. You also have the route to follow from the fire station to the fire and the total response time. You must create a plan to coordinate the firefighter actions to address the fire. Ensure that the information unified is coherent between personnel, equipment, and vehicles. If you think some elements are missing in order to properly assess the fire, you can add additional information, but only if it is extremely necessary.
