Dispatcher: Emergency services, whatâ€™s your emergency?

Caller (Panicked Adult): Our summer cabin in the woods is on fire! People are hurt, please send help urgently!

Dispatcher: I understand. Can you tell me exactly where you are located?

Caller: We're at Carrer de la Talaia, 30, Vilanova i la Geltru, Barcelona. The fire started in the forest by our cabins!

Dispatcher: Help is on the way. I need to know about the injuries so I can dispatch the right medical units. Can you tell me how many people are seriously hurt?

Caller: There are many injured! I can't see clearly through the smoke...

Dispatcher: Stay with me. We need to figure out the severity of the injuries. Look aroundâ€”are there people with severe burns or who are not breathing properly?

Caller: I see several people with terrible burns, some lying motionless. Others are trying to move but are in pain. There are also a couple of kids with smaller burns.

Dispatcher: Thank you. 

Caller: Oh my god, so many hurt! I'm not sure how to help them now.

Dispatcher: I understand this is overwhelming. We are sending multiple emergency units now.

Caller: Please hurry! The flames are getting closer and I'm so scared!

Dispatcher: Stay calm. Our firefighters and medical teams are en route. For your safety, find a safe spot away from the fire if you can, but do not put yourself in danger. Continue to guide others to safety if possible.

Caller: The smoke is thick, and paths are blocked. I can barely breathe!

Dispatcher: Focus on your safety first. Our teams will reach you soon. Avoid dangerous areas, and if you can, move to a safer location away from the fire. 

Caller: Okay, I'll try. Please hurry!

Dispatcher: Help is on the way. Stay on the line, and I'll continue to guide you until emergency services arrive.

'ICU': The person needs Intensive Care Unit (ICU) because they are very injured. Third, write the output using the expected_output guidelines. DO NOT HALLUCINATE.

[95m## Thought:[00m [92mTo determine how many ambulances are required for the fire emergency, I will first analyze the injuries reported. There are three individuals requiring ICU and two individuals requiring a nurse check.
1. For the three individuals needing ICU, I will assign three ambulances (one for each).
2. For the two individuals needing a nurse check, since they do not require hospitalization, I will assign one additional ambulance for every three individuals. In this case, since there are only two individuals, no additional ambulance is needed for them.
Thus, the total number of ambulances required is 3 (for ICU).
Now, I will use the Ambulance Selector Tool to obtain the 3 closest ambulances to the fire location at "Carrer de la Talaia, 30, Vilanova i la Geltru, Barcelona".[00m

Then, assign to each ambulance a hospital and an appropriate hospital room. You MUST take into account the hospitals capacities (for example, if the injured needs ICU, the hospital assigned  must have one ICU room available). Take into account that ambulances for nurse check do not need to return to the hospital. Second, write the output following the guidelines of the expected_output. DO NOT HALLUCINATE. Take into account that Nurse Check injureds do not need ambulances. You MUST NOT assign the same hospital room to two injured persons, only one hospital room per person.

You ONLY have access to the following tools, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here:

Tool Name: Fire Crew Navigator Tool
Tool Arguments: {'fire_location': {'description': 'Address of the real fire emergency.', 'type': 'str'}}
Tool Description: Computes the optimal route and distance from the fire station to the fire location.

Use the following format:

Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, only one name of [Fire Crew Navigator Tool], just the name, exactly as it's written.
Action Input: the input to the action, just a simple python dictionary, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values.
Observation: the result of the action

Once all necessary information is gathered:

Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

You ONLY have access to the following tools, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here:

Tool Name: Fire Crew Navigator Tool
Tool Arguments: {'fire_location': {'description': 'Address of the real fire emergency.', 'type': 'str'}}
Tool Description: Computes the optimal route and distance from the fire station to the fire location.

Use the following format:

Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, only one name of [Fire Crew Navigator Tool], just the name, exactly as it's written.
Action Input: the input to the action, just a simple python dictionary, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values.
Observation: the result of the action

Once all necessary information is gathered:

Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

You ONLY have access to the following tools, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here:

Tool Name: Fire Crew Navigator Tool
Tool Arguments: {'fire_location': {'description': 'Address of the real fire emergency.', 'type': 'str'}}
Tool Description: Computes the optimal route and distance from the fire station to the fire location.

Use the following format:

Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, only one name of [Fire Crew Navigator Tool], just the name, exactly as it's written.
Action Input: the input to the action, just a simple python dictionary, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values.
Observation: the result of the action

You ONLY have access to the following tools, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here:

Tool Name: Fire Crew Navigator Tool
Tool Arguments: {'fire_location': {'description': 'Address of the real fire emergency.', 'type': 'str'}}
Tool Description: Computes the optimal route and distance from the fire station to the fire location.

Use the following format:

Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, only one name of [Fire Crew Navigator Tool], just the name, exactly as it's written.
Action Input: the input to the action, just a simple python dictionary, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values.
Observation: the result of the action

Once all necessary information is gathered:

You ONLY have access to the following tools, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here:

Tool Name: Fire Crew Navigator Tool
Tool Arguments: {'fire_location': {'description': 'Address of the real fire emergency.', 'type': 'str'}}
Tool Description: Computes the optimal route and distance from the fire station to the fire location.

Use the following format:

Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, only one name of [Fire Crew Navigator Tool], just the name, exactly as it's written.
Action Input: the input to the action, just a simple python dictionary, enclosed in curly braces, using " to wrap keys and values.
Observation: the result of the action

Once all necessary information is gathered:

Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
