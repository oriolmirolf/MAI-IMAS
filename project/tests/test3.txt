Operator: Emergency Services, how may I assist you?

Caller: Hi, uh, yes, I need to report a fire. There’s a trash container on fire in my street.

Operator: Alright, can you tell me your location, please?

Caller: Yes, it’s on Raval Street, near number 34.

Operator: Got it. Is anyone injured or in immediate danger?

Caller: No, no one is hurt. It’s just the container. There’s no property nearby that’s at risk either.

Operator: Understood. Can you describe the fire? Is it large, or is it manageable at this point?

Caller: It’s not huge, but it’s burning pretty steadily. There’s a lot of smoke, and it seems to be spreading through the trash inside the container.

Operator: Alright, thank you for the information. Stay at a safe distance and avoid inhaling the smoke. We’ll dispatch the fire department to handle it.

Caller: Okay, thank you.

Operator: You’re welcome. If anything changes, please call us back.

Caller: Will do. Thanks again.

Operator: Take care.
