Emergency Services Operator: "911, what's your emergency?"

Old Lady: "Help! My house is on fire! There’s smoke everywhere, I don’t know what to do!"

Emergency Services Operator: "Stay calm, ma’am. I can help. Can you tell me the address, please?"

Old Lady: "Yes, it’s Laietana Street, 42! Hurry, please!"

Emergency Services Operator: "Thank you. We have your location. Can you tell me what started the fire?"

Old Lady: "I think it was a short circuit! I saw sparks, and then the fire started so quickly!"

Emergency Services Operator: "Understood. Are there any other people in the house?"

Old Lady: "No, no... It’s just me and my husband. But he’s badly hurt, I think."

Emergency Services Operator: "I understand, ma’am. Is your husband able to move? Can you get him out of the house?"

Old Lady: "He’s lying on the floor... he can’t move. I think he’s hurt his leg. The fire... the smoke is so thick, I can hardly breathe."

Emergency Services Operator: "Okay, stay calm. We’re sending help right away. Can you get to a window or an open area to signal for help?"

Old Lady: "I... I don’t know. I’m scared... the smoke is everywhere, and I can’t get to him."

Emergency Services Operator: "I understand, ma’am. Stay as low as possible to avoid smoke inhalation. Firefighters are on their way. Is there a way to exit the house safely, perhaps through a back door or window?"

Old Lady: "I don’t think so. The flames are too close... I can’t move."

Emergency Services Operator: "Okay, ma’am. Stay on the phone with me. Help is coming soon. We will have the firefighters at your location shortly."

Old Lady: "I’m so scared. Please hurry."

Emergency Services Operator: "We’re doing everything we can. Just stay safe and keep your phone on. Help is almost there."
